## What's Available Now

### New Features for Your Premion Project

1. **Betweenness Centrality Algorithm**
 ```python
 from graph_analytics_ai import GAEOrchestrator, AnalysisConfig
 
 config = AnalysisConfig(
 algorithm="betweenness",
 algorithm_params={"maximum_supersteps": 100},
 ...
 )
 ```

2. **Execution Reporting**
 ```python
 from graph_analytics_ai.ai.reporting import ExecutionReportFormatter
 
 formatter = ExecutionReportFormatter()
 report_md = formatter.format_report(execution_summary)
 ```

3. **Phase-Level Timing**
 ```python
 result = orchestrator.run_analysis(config)
 
 print(f"Deploy: {result.deploy_time_seconds}s")
 print(f"Load: {result.load_time_seconds}s")
 print(f"Execute: {result.execution_time_seconds}s")
 print(f"Store: {result.store_time_seconds}s")
 ```

4. **Cost Tracking (AMP)**
 ```python
 print(f"Estimated cost: ${result.estimated_cost_usd:.4f}")
 print(f"Runtime: {result.engine_runtime_minutes:.1f} min")
 ```

5. **Professional Reports**
 - Executive Summary with status and success rates
 - Timing Breakdown with visual charts
 - Cost Analysis with per-minute breakdowns
 - Performance Metrics with throughput calculations
 - Algorithm Details with per-algorithm stats
 - Error Log with detailed tracking

## Next Steps for Premion Project

### 1. Update Your Premion Project

```bash
cd ~/code/premion-graph-analytics

# Pull latest changes
pip install -e ~/code/graph-analytics-ai-platform

# Verify installation
python -c "from graph_analytics_ai.ai.execution.metrics import ExecutionSummary; print(' New features available')"
```

### 2. Use New Features (Optional)

The new features are **opt-in** and **backward compatible**. Your existing Premion code will work unchanged.

To use new features:

```python
# In your Premion project
from graph_analytics_ai import GAEOrchestrator
from graph_analytics_ai.ai.execution.metrics import ExecutionSummary, TimingBreakdown
from graph_analytics_ai.ai.reporting import ExecutionReportFormatter

# Run analysis (timing tracked automatically)
orchestrator = GAEOrchestrator()
result = orchestrator.run_analysis(your_config)

# Check timing
print(f"Graph load: {result.load_time_seconds}s")
print(f"Execution: {result.execution_time_seconds}s")
print(f"Cost: ${result.estimated_cost_usd:.4f}")

# Generate report (optional)
summary = ExecutionSummary(...) # Create from result
formatter = ExecutionReportFormatter()
report = formatter.format_report(summary)
Path("premion_execution_report.md").write_text(report)
```

### 3. Try Betweenness Centrality (Optional)

If useful for your Premion analysis:

```python
# Add betweenness centrality to your analysis
config = AnalysisConfig(
 name="Premion Betweenness Analysis",
 database="premion",
 vertex_collections=["your_vertices"],
 edge_collections=["your_edges"],
 algorithm="betweenness",
 algorithm_params={"maximum_supersteps": 100},
 target_collection="betweenness_results"
)

result = orchestrator.run_analysis(config)
```
