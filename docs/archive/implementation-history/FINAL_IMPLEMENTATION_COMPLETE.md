## Test Status

### Unit Tests
- **357 tests passing** ✅
- **1 skipped**
- **0 failures**
- No regression from new code

### Integration Tests
- **6 integration tests created** ✅
- Marked with `@pytest.mark.integration`
- Skipped by default (requires `--run-integration`)
- Requires real LLM/DB/GAE services

### Test Coverage
- **Existing code:** Fully covered (357 tests)
- **New metrics code:** Needs unit tests (~30-40 tests)
- **New reporting code:** Needs unit tests (~20-30 tests)

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Generate Execution Report

```python
from graph_analytics_ai import GAEOrchestrator
from graph_analytics_ai.ai.execution.metrics import ExecutionSummary, TimingBreakdown
from graph_analytics_ai.ai.reporting import ExecutionReportFormatter

# Run analysis (automatically tracks metrics)
orchestrator = GAEOrchestrator()
result = orchestrator.run_analysis(config)

# Create summary
summary = ExecutionSummary(
    workflow_id="analysis_001",
    started_at=result.start_time,
    completed_at=result.end_time,
    templates_executed=1,
    templates_succeeded=1
)

# Add timing
summary.timing_breakdown = TimingBreakdown(
    graph_load_seconds=result.load_time_seconds,
    algorithm_execution_seconds=result.execution_time_seconds,
    results_store_seconds=result.store_time_seconds,
    total_seconds=result.duration_seconds
)

# Generate report
formatter = ExecutionReportFormatter()
report_md = formatter.format_report(summary)

# Save
Path("execution_report.md").write_text(report_md)
```

### Example 2: Run Integration Tests

```bash
# Setup test database
python tests/integration/fixtures/test_database_setup.py

# Run integration tests
pytest tests/integration/ --run-integration -v

# Run specific test
pytest tests/integration/test_workflow_e2e.py::TestWorkflowE2E::test_complete_workflow_with_real_services --run-integration -v

# Cleanup
python tests/integration/fixtures/test_database_setup.py cleanup
```

### Example 3: Custom Report Configuration

```python
from graph_analytics_ai.ai.reporting import ReportConfig, ReportSection

# Minimal report
config = ReportConfig(
    include_sections=[ReportSection.EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY],
    include_costs=False
)

# Detailed report
config = ReportConfig(
    include_all_sections=True,
    include_detailed_timing=True,
    include_raw_metrics=True,
    decimal_places=4
)

formatter = ExecutionReportFormatter(config)
```
