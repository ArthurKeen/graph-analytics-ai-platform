# Cleanup Recommendations

Now that the agentic workflow is working successfully, you can clean up temporary files created during debugging.

## Keep These (Library-Based)

### Main Scripts:
- `run_full_agentic_workflow.py` - **MAIN SCRIPT** for agentic workflow
- `view_agentic_results.py` - View workflow results

### Documentation:
- `PREMION_WORKFLOW_SUCCESS.md` - Complete success summary
- `LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE_SUMMARY.md` - Architecture explanation 
- `consumer_media_use_cases.md` - Your business requirements (INPUT)

### Outputs:
- `premion_agentic_state.json` - Workflow execution state
- `premion_workflow_output/` - LLM-generated documents

---

## Can Delete (Debugging Scripts)

These were created during troubleshooting and are no longer needed:

### Connection Testing:
```bash
rm test_premion_connection.py
rm inspect_premion_database.py
rm inspect_premion_fixed.py
rm list_all_collections.py
rm inspect_sharding.py
```

### Manual Execution (Now Handled by AgenticWorkflowRunner):
```bash
rm run_premion_workflow.py # Old workflow orchestrator approach
rm run_wcc_household_stitching.py # Custom WCC execution
rm generate_premion_templates.py # Manual template generation
rm execute_templates_properly.py # Exploration script
```

### Debugging/One-off Scripts:
```bash
rm debug_job_status.py
rm store_wcc_results.py
rm create_result_collection.py
rm query_household_results.py
```

### Old Outputs (Keep most recent only):
```bash
rm -rf premion_gae_templates/ # Manually created templates (agents now generate them)
```

---

## Optional: Clean Up Library Scripts

If you want to keep the repository pristine:

### Keep Reference Examples:
- `run_agentic_workflow.py` - Alternative approach (WorkflowOrchestrator)

### Or Consolidate:
Since `run_full_agentic_workflow.py` is the complete solution, you could:
```bash
# Rename for clarity
mv run_full_agentic_workflow.py run_agentic_premion.py
rm run_agentic_workflow.py # Remove partial workflow version
```

---

## Recommended File Structure

After cleanup:

```
graph-analytics-ai-platform/
 consumer_media_use_cases.md ← Your input
 .env ← Configuration
 run_agentic_premion.py ← Main script
 view_agentic_results.py ← Results viewer
 PREMION_WORKFLOW_SUCCESS.md ← Summary
 premion_agentic_state.json ← Workflow state
 premion_workflow_output/ ← Generated docs
 product_requirements.md
 use_cases.md
 schema_analysis.md
 graph_analytics_ai/ ← Library (unchanged)
```

---

## Cleanup Commands

### Quick Cleanup (Remove All Debugging Scripts):
```bash
# Remove temporary scripts
rm test_premion_connection.py \
 inspect_premion_database.py \
 inspect_premion_fixed.py \
 list_all_collections.py \
 inspect_sharding.py \
 run_premion_workflow.py \
 run_wcc_household_stitching.py \
 generate_premion_templates.py \
 execute_templates_properly.py \
 debug_job_status.py \
 store_wcc_results.py \
 create_result_collection.py \
 query_household_results.py

# Remove old manual templates
rm -rf premion_gae_templates/

echo " Cleanup complete!"
```

### Conservative Cleanup (Keep Reference Scripts):
```bash
# Only remove debugging/inspection scripts
rm test_premion_connection.py \
 inspect_*.py \
 list_all_collections.py \
 debug_job_status.py \
 store_wcc_results.py \
 create_result_collection.py

echo " Debugging scripts removed"
```

## Rationale

### Why Delete Them?

1. **No Longer Needed**: The `AgenticWorkflowRunner` handles everything they did
2. **Confusing**: Multiple scripts doing similar things
3. **Not General Purpose**: They contain Premion-specific logic
4. **Maintenance Burden**: More files to keep updated

### Why Keep Some?

- `run_full_agentic_workflow.py`: **Production script** for running workflows
- `view_agentic_results.py`: Useful for viewing any workflow results
- Documentation files: Reference material

---

## After Cleanup

You'll have a clean repository with:
- One main script to run workflows
- Clear documentation
- No confusing duplicate scripts
- Library remains unchanged and general-purpose

**The library never needed Premion-specific modifications!**
