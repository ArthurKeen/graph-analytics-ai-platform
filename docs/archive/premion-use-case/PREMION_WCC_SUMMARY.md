## Blocking Issue

### `store_results` API Failure with AMP Sharded Databases

**Problem**: The WCC computation completes successfully, but the `store_results` API call does NOT persist data back to the sharded ArangoDB database.

**Symptoms**:
- API call returns "success" status
- No collection `household_components` is created
- No `component_id` attributes added to Device/IP collections
- Waited 3+ minutes multiple times - results never appear
- Issue is consistently reproducible across multiple attempts

**API Call Used**:
```python
gae.store_results(
 target_collection="household_components",
 job_ids=["2"],
 attribute_names=["component_id"],
 database="sharded_premion_graph"
)
```

**Expected Behavior**:
- Create new collection `household_components`
- Store WCC results with `component_id` for each Device/IP node
- Allow querying: "Given device X, find all devices in same household"

**Actual Behavior**:
- API returns success immediately
- No data written to database (even after 3+ minutes)
- Collection not created
- Results lost when engine shuts down

---

## Root Cause Analysis

### Hypothesis 1: Async Write Not Completing
The `store_results` API appears to be **asynchronous** - it accepts the request but actual database writes happen in background. The write may be failing silently or timing out for sharded databases.

### Hypothesis 2: AMP Sharded Database Limitation
The GAE `store_results` endpoint may not support writing to **sharded/distributed** ArangoDB deployments in AMP mode. This could be:
- A known limitation
- Missing permissions
- Different API endpoint required for sharded DBs

### Hypothesis 3: Engine Shutdown Timing
GAE engines auto-shutdown after ~15-20 minutes of inactivity. If the background write process is slow, the engine may shut down before completing the write.

---

## Technical Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed Job Status Detection
**Issue**: Job status showed "unknown" continuously 
**Fix**: Use `progress == total` as primary completion indicator (not `state` field)
```python
if progress >= total and total > 0:
 # Job is complete
```

### 2. Added Result Verification
**Issue**: API reported success but no data written 
**Fix**: Poll database to verify collection creation and data presence
```python
while time.time() - start_wait < max_wait:
 if db.has_collection(target_collection):
 if collection.count() > 0:
 # Verified!
```

### 3. Proper Token Management
**Issue**: Overnight token expiry 
**Fix**: Fresh token generated on each run

## What Was Accomplished

Despite the storage issue, we successfully:

1. Connected to Premion production database
2. Analyzed graph schema (211K vertices, 264K edges)
3. Parsed business use cases from `consumer_media_use_cases.md`
4. Generated 5 production-ready GAE templates
5. Deployed GAE engines on AMP
6. Loaded full graph (60K devices + 60K IPs) into GAE
7. Executed WCC algorithm successfully (0.3s)
8. Identified household clusters in memory

**Missing**: Persisting results back to the database

## Recommended Next Steps

### Option 1: Contact ArangoDB Support (Recommended)
**Issue**: `store_results` API not working with AMP sharded databases

**Questions for Support**:
1. Does `store_results` support sharded databases in AMP mode?
2. Is there an alternative API endpoint for sharded deployments?
3. Are there specific permissions required for GAE → Sharded DB writes?
4. Can results be exported directly from GAE before engine shutdown?

**Reference Information**:
- Database: `sharded_premion_graph` (AMP)
- Cluster: `31a55ba6a81d.arangodb.cloud:8529`
- GAE Mode: AMP (Arango Managed Platform)
- API: `v1/storeresults` endpoint
- Error: Silent failure - returns success but no data written

### Option 2: Try Non-Sharded Database
Create a test database without sharding to verify if `store_results` works:
```bash
# Create non-sharded test database
# Re-run WCC on smaller dataset
# Verify if store_results works
```

### Option 3: Direct GAE Result Export
Investigate if GAE has alternative export methods:
- Direct JSON export from engine
- Custom result retrieval endpoint
- Manual result extraction before engine shutdown

### Option 4: Use Self-Managed GAE
If you have self-managed ArangoDB deployment:
- Try `GenAIGAEConnection` instead of `GAEManager`
- May have different result storage mechanisms

## Value Delivered (When Storage Works)

Once the `store_results` issue is resolved, you will have:

### Household Identity Graph
- Every Device/IP tagged with `component_id` (PHID)
- Query: "Find all devices in household" → instant lookup
- Enables cross-device targeting and attribution

### Query Examples
```javascript
// Find household for a device
FOR doc IN household_components
 FILTER doc._id == 'Device/YOUR_ID'
 RETURN doc.component_id

// Find all devices in same household
FOR doc IN household_components
 FILTER doc.component_id == 'HOUSEHOLD_ID'
 FILTER doc._id LIKE 'Device/%'
 RETURN doc

// Count households by size
FOR doc IN household_components
 COLLECT household = doc.component_id WITH COUNT INTO size
 RETURN {household, size}
```

### Business Impact
- **Household-level targeting**: Target all screens in a home
- **Cross-device attribution**: Track CTV → Mobile conversions
- **Fraud detection**: Filter high-cardinality IPs
- **Audience segments**: Propagate interests across household
- **Inventory forecasting**: Rank influential content sources
