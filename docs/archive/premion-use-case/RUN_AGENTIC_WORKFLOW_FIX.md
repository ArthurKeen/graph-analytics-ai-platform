# run_agentic_workflow.py - Fixed to be Generic

## Problem
The `run_agentic_workflow.py` script was customer-specific (Premion), which is incorrect for the library project.

## What Was Wrong
```python
# BEFORE - Customer-specific
use_case_file = "consumer_media_use_cases.md" # Premion file
database_name = "sharded_premion_graph" # Premion database
output_dir = "./premion_workflow_output" # Premion output
product_name = "Premion Identity Graph Analytics"
```

## What Was Fixed
```python
# AFTER - Generic library example
use_case_file = "examples/use_case_document.md" # Generic e-commerce example
database_name = os.getenv("ARANGO_DATABASE", "graph-analytics-ai") # From .env
output_dir = "./workflow_output" # Generic output
product_name = "Graph Analytics AI - Example Workflow"
```

## Changes Made

1. **Title**: "PREMION - AGENTIC WORKFLOW" → "GRAPH ANALYTICS AI - WORKFLOW EXAMPLE"
2. **Use Case**: `consumer_media_use_cases.md` → `examples/use_case_document.md`
3. **Database**: Hardcoded Premion database → Read from `.env` (`ARANGO_DATABASE`)
4. **Output Dir**: `premion_workflow_output` → `workflow_output`
5. **Product Name**: "Premion Identity Graph Analytics" → "Graph Analytics AI - Example Workflow"
6. **Documentation**: Added note about creating separate projects for customer implementations

## Generic Use Case
The script now uses `examples/use_case_document.md` which contains a generic e-commerce scenario:
- **Scenario**: Customer Intelligence Platform
- **Objectives**: Identify influencers, discover communities, optimize recommendations
- **Data**: Generic customers, products, purchases (not customer-specific)
- **Graph**: `ecommerce_graph` (example)

## Test Database
The script now connects to the test database from `.env`:
- **Database**: `graph-analytics-ai` (from test credentials)
- **Endpoint**: From `ARANGO_ENDPOINT` environment variable
- **Flexible**: Works with any database configured in `.env`

## Why This Matters

**Library Project** (graph-analytics-ai-platform):
- Should contain only generic, reusable examples
- Should work with test database
- Should demonstrate library capabilities
- Should NOT contain customer-specific code

**Customer Project** (premion-graph-analytics):
- Contains customer-specific use cases
- Uses production database
- Imports the library as a dependency
- Implements customer requirements

## Result

The script is now a proper **library example** that:
- Works with test database credentials
- Uses generic e-commerce scenario
- Demonstrates library capabilities
- Can be run by anyone using the library
- Serves as a template for customer projects

**Status:** Generic library example - Ready for testing
