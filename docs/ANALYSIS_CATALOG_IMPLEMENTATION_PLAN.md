### ArangoDB Collections

```
_analysis_epochs # Epoch records

_analysis_use_cases # Use case records
_analysis_templates # Template records
_analysis_executions # Execution records (main)
_analysis_alerts # Alert rules
_analysis_alert_history # Alert trigger history
```

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Storage Abstraction**: Use abstract base class for storage to support multiple backends

2. **Thread-Safety**: Use locks for all write operations, async locks for async operations

3. **Atomic Operations**: Use ArangoDB transactions for multi-collection operations

4. **Indexing Strategy**:
 - Primary keys on all ID fields
 - Hash indexes on foreign keys (epoch_id, requirements_id, etc.)
 - Skiplist indexes on timestamps for time-series queries
 - Composite indexes for common query patterns

5. **Performance Optimization**:
 - Store result samples directly in execution records
 - Use AQL queries for complex aggregations
 - Cache frequently accessed data (consider adding caching layer in future)

6. **Error Handling**:
 - Graceful degradation (catalog errors don't crash workflows)
 - Track failed executions
 - Detailed error messages with context

## Open Questions for Decision

### Technical Decisions

1. **Result Sampling Configuration**
 - Q: What should be the default sample size?
 - Options: 50, 100, 200
 - Recommendation: **100** (good balance of detail vs storage)

2. **Alert Channels Priority**
 - Q: Which alert channels to implement first?
 - Options: Email, Slack, PagerDuty, Webhook
 - Recommendation: **Email + Webhook** (covers most use cases)

3. **Cost Tracking**
 - Q: Should we integrate with cloud provider APIs for automatic cost tracking?
 - Options: Manual, AWS/GCP integration, Both
 - Recommendation: **Manual for MVP** (users provide cost_usd), cloud integration in v2

4. **Storage for Alert Rules**
 - Q: Store alert rules in ArangoDB or separate config files?
 - Recommendation: **ArangoDB** (consistent with rest of catalog)

5. **Thread-Safety Approach**
 - Q: Use locks or rely on ArangoDB transactions?
 - Recommendation: **Both** (locks for in-memory state, transactions for DB)

### Process Decisions

6. **Code Review Process**
 - Q: How should code reviews be structured?
 - Recommendation: Each phase reviewed before proceeding to next

7. **Testing During Development**
 - Q: Run tests continuously or at phase boundaries?

- Test database separate from production

**Testing:**
- CI/CD with ArangoDB Docker image
- Test data fixtures

**Production:**
- Same ArangoDB as graph data
- Backup strategy for catalog collections

## Post-MVP Roadmap

### v2.0 (Weeks 15-21) - Advanced Features

**Priorities:**
1. FR-12: Audit Trail (compliance)
2. FR-16: Template Versioning (experimentation tracking)
3. FR-17: Golden Epochs (regression testing)
4. FR-14: Schedule Tracking (SLA monitoring)

**Estimated:** 7 weeks

### v3.0 (Future) - Enterprise Features

**Priorities:**
1. FR-15: Analysis Dependencies (complex workflows)
2. FR-18: Data Quality Metrics
3. FR-19: Collaboration Features
4. FR-20: Integration Hooks

**Estimated:** 8-10 weeks

## Recommendation

**Proceed with this plan?**

This implementation plan delivers a **production-ready Analysis Catalog** in 14 weeks with:
- Complete execution and lineage tracking
- Time-series analysis capabilities
- Performance monitoring and cost tracking
- Fast queries with result sampling (10-100x speedup)
- Execution comparison for debugging
- Alerting for operational monitoring
- Integration with all 3 workflow modes

**Estimated Effort:** 14 weeks with 1-2 developers

**Next Steps:**
1. Review and approve this plan
2. Answer open questions (1-8)
3. Set up development environment
4. Create implementation tickets
5. Begin Phase 1: Foundation
