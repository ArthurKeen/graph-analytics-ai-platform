# Agentic Workflow Analysis

## Is This Project a Candidate for Agentic Workflow?

**Short Answer: Yes, this project is an excellent candidate for an agentic workflow approach.**

## Current Workflow (Linear/Orchestrated)

The current design follows a **linear orchestrated workflow**:
1. Step 1 → Step 2 → Step 3 → ... → Step 7
2. Each step executes in sequence
3. Decisions are made by LLM prompts, not autonomous agents
4. Limited ability to adapt or reason about intermediate results

## Why Agentic Workflow Would Be Beneficial

### 1. Complex Decision-Making Requirements

**Current Challenge:** The workflow requires making complex decisions at multiple points:
- Which graph algorithms are most appropriate for specific business requirements?
- How to optimize analysis parameters based on graph size and structure?
- How to interpret results and generate actionable recommendations?

**Agentic Solution:** Specialized agents can reason about these decisions:
- **Schema Analysis Agent:** Analyzes graph structure and identifies patterns
- **Algorithm Selection Agent:** Chooses optimal algorithms based on requirements and schema
- **Optimization Agent:** Adjusts parameters and engine sizes based on graph characteristics
- **Interpretation Agent:** Reasons about results and generates insights

### 2. Multi-Domain Expertise

**Current Challenge:** The workflow spans multiple domains:
- Graph database schema understanding
- Business requirements analysis
- Algorithm selection and configuration
- Result interpretation and business intelligence

**Agentic Solution:** Domain-specific agents:
- **Business Analyst Agent:** Understands business requirements and objectives
- **Graph Schema Agent:** Expert in graph database structures and patterns
- **Analytics Agent:** Expert in graph algorithms and their applications
- **Reporting Agent:** Expert in translating technical results to business insights

### 3. Adaptive Workflow Execution

**Current Challenge:** Linear workflow doesn't adapt to:
- Unexpected schema patterns
- Missing or incomplete requirements
- Analysis results that suggest different approaches
- Errors or edge cases

**Agentic Solution:** Agents can:
- **Reason about next steps** based on current state
- **Adapt the workflow** when unexpected situations arise
- **Make autonomous decisions** about retries, alternatives, or optimizations
- **Collaborate** with other agents to solve complex problems

### 4. Quality and Validation

**Current Challenge:** Validation happens at fixed points, may miss issues

**Agentic Solution:** Validation agents can:
- **Continuously monitor** workflow progress
- **Validate outputs** at each step
- **Suggest improvements** or corrections
- **Ensure consistency** across the workflow

 participant User
 participant Orch as Orchestrator Agent
 participant Vert as Industry Vertical Resolver
 participant Schema as Schema Analysis Agent
 participant Req as Requirements Agent
 participant UseCase as Use Case Agent
 participant Template as Template Agent
 participant Exec as Execution Agent
 participant Report as Reporting Agent
 participant Catalog as Analytics Catalog
 
 User->>Orch: "Analyze customer database for fraud detection"

 Orch->>Vert: Resolve industry prompt (built-in/custom/auto-generate)
 Vert-->>Orch: Industry prompt + domain patterns loaded
 Orch->>Catalog: Create/reuse epoch for this run
 
 par Parallel Analysis
 Orch->>Schema: Analyze schema
 Orch->>Req: Extract requirements
 end
 
 Schema-->>Orch: "Transaction network, 1M+ edges"
 Req-->>Orch: "Detect fraudulent patterns"
 Orch->>Catalog: Track requirements (lineage root)
 
 Orch->>UseCase: Generate use cases for fraud detection
 UseCase-->>Orch: "PageRank for influencers, WCC for communities"
 Orch->>Catalog: Track use cases
 
 Orch->>Template: Create optimized templates
 Template-->>Orch: "2 templates (e32 engine)"
 Orch->>Catalog: Track templates
 
 Orch->>Exec: Execute analyses
 Exec-->>Orch: "Completed successfully"
 Orch->>Catalog: Track executions (with results + performance)
 
 Orch->>Report: Generate actionable report
 Report-->>Orch: "3 high-risk communities identified"
 
 Orch-->>User: Complete fraud detection report
 
 Note over Schema,Req: Phase 1: Run in parallel
 Note over Exec: Phase 4: Templates execute in parallel
 Note over Report: Phase 5: Reports generate in parallel
```

**Key Steps:**

1. **Orchestrator** receives goal: "Analyze customer database for fraud detection"
2. **Parallel Analysis**: Schema Analysis + Requirements Extraction run concurrently
3. **Schema Agent** identifies: "Transaction network with 1M+ edges"
4. **Requirements Agent** extracts: "Detect fraudulent transaction patterns"
5. **Use Case Agent** generates: "PageRank for influential nodes, WCC for communities"
6. **Template Agent** configures: "e32 engine for 1M+ edges"
7. **Execution Agent** runs analyses and monitors progress
8. **Reporting Agent** creates actionable report with insights

## Comparison: Linear vs Agentic

| Aspect | Linear Workflow | Agentic Workflow |
|--------|----------------|------------------|
| **Decision Making** | LLM prompts | Autonomous agents |
| **Adaptability** | Limited | High |
| **Quality** | Good | Excellent |
| **Complexity** | Lower | Higher |
| **Execution Speed** | Sequential | Can parallelize |
| **Error Handling** | Fixed retry logic | Adaptive recovery |
| **Explainability** | Limited | High (agent reasoning) |
| **Maintenance** | Easier | More complex |

## Recommendation

**Yes, implement agentic workflow, but with a phased approach:**

1. **Start with Linear** (v2.0.0) - Get the workflow working
2. **Add Agentic Mode** (v2.1.0) - Optional agentic execution
3. **Make Agentic Default** (v2.2.0) - When proven and stable
4. **Enhance Agents** (v2.3.0) - Add learning and collaboration

## Next Steps

1. **Evaluate Frameworks:** Test LangGraph, AutoGen, CrewAI
2. **Design Agent Architecture:** Define agent roles and communication
3. **Create Prototype:** Build simple agentic workflow
4. **Compare Results:** Linear vs Agentic on same use cases
