# Custom Industry Verticals - Quick Start

**Feature Status:** Phase 1 MVP - Basic Implementation

---

## What This Is

Automatically generate custom industry verticals from your business requirements document. No need to modify platform code to add new industries!

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Create Enhanced Business Requirements

Use the template at `templates/business_requirements_template.md`

**Key sections to fill out:**
- Domain Overview (industry, business function)
- Domain Terminology (currency, units, regulations, thresholds)
- Graph Structure (nodes and edges)
- Key Metrics & KPIs
- Patterns to Detect
- Reporting & Deliverables (interactive HTML vs markdown vs JSON)
- **Example Insights** (most important - shows what good looks like)

### 2. Generate Your Custom Vertical

```bash
cd ~/code/your-project

# Generate from business requirements
python -m graph_analytics_ai.cli.generate_vertical \
  --input docs/business_requirements.md \
  --graph-name your_graph_name \
  --validate \
  --interactive
```

**Output:** `.graph-analytics/industry_vertical.json`

### 3. Use in Your Workflow

```python
from graph_analytics_ai.ai.agents import AgenticWorkflowRunner

# The runner will automatically detect and load the custom vertical
runner = AgenticWorkflowRunner(
    graph_name="your_graph_name",
    industry="your_industry_name"  # Matches the name in vertical JSON
)

state = await runner.run_async(
    input_files=["docs/business_requirements.md"]
)
```

**That's it!** The platform automatically finds and uses your custom vertical.

---

## How It Works

```
1. You create: docs/business_requirements.md (comprehensive)
2. You run: python -m graph_analytics_ai.cli.generate_vertical
3. Platform generates: .graph-analytics/industry_vertical.json
4. You review and edit: Add refinements if needed
5. You run workflow: Uses custom vertical automatically
6. Platform generates: Domain-specific insights!
```

## Example

### Input: Supply Chain Business Requirements

```markdown
# Supply Chain Requirements

## 1. Domain Overview
Industry: Supply Chain & Logistics
Primary Function: Detect supply chain bottlenecks and single points of failure

## 3. Graph Structure
Nodes: Supplier, Warehouse, Product, ShipmentRoute
Edges: suppliesTo, stores, shipsVia, dependsOn

## 5. Patterns to Detect
**Single Point of Failure:**
- One supplier with no backup
- > 30% production depends on it
- Business Impact: Production halt if fails

## 8. Example Insights
Title: Single Point of Failure - Supplier S-123
Description: Sole provider of Component X (40% of products)...
Business Impact: $2.4M/week at risk, need backup suppliers...
```

### Output: .graph-analytics/industry_vertical.json

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "name": "supply_chain",
    "display_name": "Supply Chain & Logistics",
    "version": "1.0"
  },
  "analysis_prompt": "You are analyzing a supply chain graph...\n\nDetect patterns like:\n- Single points of failure (critical suppliers)\n- Geographic concentration risks\n...",
  "pattern_definitions": {
    "wcc": [
      {
        "name": "single_point_of_failure",
        "description": "Critical supplier with no alternatives",
        "risk_level": "CRITICAL"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Result: Domain-Specific Insights

```
Report: Supply Chain Risk Analysis

Insights:
  [CRITICAL] Single Point of Failure: Supplier S-456
    • Sole provider of hydraulic components (45% of product line)
    • No backup suppliers identified
    • Current inventory: 8 days (below 7-day critical threshold)
    • Financial exposure: $3.2M/week if disrupted
    
    IMMEDIATE: Flag for enhanced monitoring, audit inventory daily
    SHORT-TERM: Identify 2 backup suppliers within 45 days
    LONG-TERM: Implement dual-sourcing for all critical components
    
    Confidence: 0.89
```

## Commands

### Generate Vertical

```bash
# Basic
python -m graph_analytics_ai.cli.generate_vertical \
  --input docs/business_requirements.md \
  --graph-name my_graph

# With all options
python -m graph_analytics_ai.cli.generate_vertical \

### Test with Real Project

```bash
cd ~/code/your-project

# Make sure you have enhanced business requirements
# (see templates/business_requirements_template.md)

python -m graph_analytics_ai.cli.generate_vertical \
  --input docs/business_requirements.md \
  --graph-name your_graph \
  --validate \
  --interactive
```

## Tips for Best Results

### 1. Provide Detailed Example Insights (Section 8)

**This is the most important section!** The more detailed and realistic your example insights are, the better the generated prompt will be.

**Good example:**
```
Title: Specific Pattern Name with Numbers
Description: 500+ words with entity IDs, percentages, context
Business Impact: Specific actions with timelines and financial impact
Confidence: 0.85+
```

### 2. Be Specific About Terminology

Don't just say "currency: USD". Add context:
```
Currency: USD millions for revenue, USD for costs
Units: pallets (inventory), days (lead time), percentage (fill rate)
```

### 3. Define Clear Risk Levels

```
CRITICAL: Production halt, > $1M impact, 0-4 hour response
HIGH: Significant disruption, > $100K impact, 24-48 hour response
```

### 4. Include Domain-Specific Regulations

```
Regulations:
- Import/Export Compliance: Required documentation for international shipments
- Customs: Duty calculations and border clearance requirements
- FDA: Regulations for pharmaceutical product handling
```

## Troubleshooting

### "No custom vertical found"

**Cause:** File doesn't exist at `.graph-analytics/industry_vertical.json`

**Fix:** Run `generate_vertical` command first

### "Validation failed"

**Cause:** Generated JSON doesn't match schema

**Fix:** Review the JSON, fix errors manually, or use `--force` to save anyway

### "Low quality prompt generated"

**Cause:** Business requirements lack detail, especially example insights

**Fix:** 
1. Add detailed example insights (section 8)
2. Expand terminology and patterns sections
3. Regenerate

### "Wrong industry key in vertical"

**Cause:** LLM extracted incorrect name from requirements

**Fix:** Edit `.graph-analytics/industry_vertical.json` and change `metadata.name`
