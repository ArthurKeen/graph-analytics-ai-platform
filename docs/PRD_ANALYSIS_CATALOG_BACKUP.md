## Executive Summary

The Analysis Catalog system provides comprehensive tracking, management, and time-series analysis capabilities for graph analytics executions. By introducing the concept of "Analysis Epochs" (coordinated sets of analyses run at specific points in time), this feature enables temporal analysis of graph evolution through metrics like influence changes, community shifts, and connectivity patterns over time.

**Key Benefits:**
- Track complete history of all graph analyses
- Enable time-series analysis of graph invariant metrics
- Compare graph evolution across multiple epochs
- Support reproducible testing with multi-epoch scenarios
- Facilitate change detection and trend analysis

## Problem Statement

### Current State
The platform currently executes graph analytics algorithms and generates reports, but lacks:
- Historical tracking of analysis executions
- Ability to compare results across time periods
- Structured way to group related analyses
- Time-series analysis of graph metrics
- Testing framework for multi-epoch scenarios

### Desired State
Users should be able to:
- Track every analysis execution with complete metadata
- Group analyses into logical "epochs" (time-based snapshots)
- Query historical analysis results
- Compare graph metrics across multiple epochs
- Analyze trends in graph invariant metrics over time
- Test graph evolution scenarios with multiple epochs

### Impact
**For Data Scientists:**
- Answer questions like "How has customer influence changed over the last 6 months?"
- Detect anomalies in graph structure evolution
- Validate graph evolution hypotheses

**For Engineers:**
- Debug production issues by comparing historical results
- Test algorithms against evolving graph structures
- Ensure reproducibility of analyses

**For Business Users:**
- Track KPIs derived from graph metrics over time
- Identify trends in network behavior
- Make data-driven decisions based on graph evolution

   - Traditional Orchestrator (step-by-step control)
   - Agentic Workflow (autonomous AI agents)
   - Parallel Agentic Workflow (fastest with parallel execution)
3. **Epoch Management**: Support grouping of analyses into logical time-based epochs
4. **Time-Series Analysis**: Enable querying and comparing metrics across epochs
5. **Catalog Management**: Provide CRUD operations for analysis records
6. **Testing Support**: Enable multi-epoch testing scenarios
7. **Query Capabilities**: Allow flexible querying of historical analyses

### Non-Goals
1. **Real-time Analysis**: Not building a streaming/real-time analysis system

---

## Open Questions

### Q1: Storage Location
**Question:** Should catalog be stored in same database as graph data, or separate?

**Options:**
A. Same database (default for ArangoDB)
B. Separate database
C. Configurable

**Recommendation:** Start with same database (A), make configurable later (C).

**Rationale:** Simpler setup, transactional consistency, can query graph and catalog together.

---

### Q2: Epoch Hierarchy
**Question:** Should epochs support parent-child relationships?

**Example:** 
- Parent: "2026-Q1" 
  - Child: "2026-01"
  - Child: "2026-02"
  - Child: "2026-03"

**Recommendation:** Include `parent_epoch_id` field, but don't enforce hierarchy in v1. Add hierarchy queries in v2 if needed.

---

### Q3: Result Snapshot Storage
**Question:** Should we store snapshots of top results in catalog, or always query result collections?

**Options:**
A. Always query result collections (current plan)
B. Store top N results in catalog (e.g., top 100 PageRank scores)
C. Configurable

**Trade-offs:**
- A: Minimal storage, always fresh data, requires result collections to exist
- B: Faster queries, works even if result collections deleted, more storage
- C: Best of both, more complexity

**Recommendation:** Start with A, add B as optional feature if users request it.

---

### Q4: Automatic Epoch Creation
**Question:** Should system automatically create epochs (e.g., daily) or always user-driven?

**Recommendation:** User-driven in v1. Add automatic scheduling in v2 if needed.

---

### Q5: Catalog Permissions
**Question:** How should catalog access be controlled?

**Options:**
A. Same permissions as graph database
B. Separate catalog permissions
C. Public read, restricted write

**Recommendation:** Start with A for simplicity.

## Appendix A: Example Usage Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Track Daily Analyses

```python
from graph_analytics_ai.catalog import AnalysisCatalog
from graph_analytics_ai.ai.execution import AnalysisExecutor
from datetime import datetime

# Initialize with automatic tracking
catalog = AnalysisCatalog()
executor = AnalysisExecutor(catalog=catalog)

# Create daily epoch
today = datetime.now().date()
epoch = catalog.create_epoch(
    name=f"daily-{today}",
    description=f"Daily analysis for {today}",
    tags=["daily", "production"]
)

# Run standard analyses
for template in standard_templates:
    executor.execute_template(
        template,
        epoch_id=epoch.epoch_id
    )

# Mark epoch as completed
catalog.update_epoch(epoch.epoch_id, status="completed")
```

### Scenario 2: Compare Influence Changes

```python
# Get last 30 days of PageRank results
end_date = datetime.now()
start_date = end_date - timedelta(days=30)

# Get time-series of top influencer scores
top_influencers = catalog.compare_epochs(
    metric="pagerank.score",
    algorithm="pagerank",
    start_date=start_date,
    end_date=end_date,
    top_n=20
)

# Analyze changes

### Scenario 3: Multi-Epoch Testing

```python
import pytest
from graph_analytics_ai.catalog import AnalysisCatalog
from graph_analytics_ai.testing import EpochTestCase

class TestGraphEvolution(EpochTestCase):
    """Test graph metric changes over time."""
    
    def test_hub_addition_increases_centralization(self):
        """Adding a hub node should increase graph centralization."""
        catalog = self.get_catalog()
        graph = self.get_test_graph()
        executor = self.get_executor()
        
        # Epoch 1: Baseline
        epoch1 = self.create_epoch("baseline")
        result1 = executor.execute_template(
            self.pagerank_template,
            epoch_id=epoch1.epoch_id
        )
        centralization1 = self.calculate_centralization(result1)
        
        # Add hub node with 30 connections
        hub_id = graph.add_hub_node(degree=30)
        
        # Epoch 2: After hub
        epoch2 = self.create_epoch("after-hub")
        result2 = executor.execute_template(
            self.pagerank_template,
            epoch_id=epoch2.epoch_id
        )
        centralization2 = self.calculate_centralization(result2)
        
        # Assert centralization increased
        assert centralization2 > centralization1
        
        # Assert hub is now top influencer
        top_node = self.get_top_node(result2)
        assert top_node == hub_id
```

### Scenario 4: Catalog Management

```python
# Export catalog for backup
catalog.export_catalog(
    output_path="catalog_backup_2026_01_06.json",
    format="json"
)

# Get catalog statistics
stats = catalog.get_statistics()
print(f"Total Executions: {stats.total_executions}")
print(f"Total Epochs: {stats.total_epochs}")
print(f"Date Range: {stats.earliest_execution} to {stats.latest_execution}")
print(f"Algorithms Used: {stats.algorithms_used}")

# Clean up old test data
test_epochs = catalog.list_epochs(
    filter=EpochFilter(tags=["test"])
)
for epoch in test_epochs:
    catalog.delete_epoch(epoch.epoch_id, cascade=True)
print(f"Deleted {len(test_epochs)} test epochs")

# Archive old production epochs
old_date = datetime.now() - timedelta(days=365)
old_epochs = catalog.list_epochs(
    filter=EpochFilter(end_date=old_date)
)
for epoch in old_epochs:
    catalog.update_epoch(
        epoch.epoch_id,
        status=EpochStatus.ARCHIVED
    )
```

## Appendix B: Alternative Approaches Considered

### Alternative 1: Versioned Graph Storage
**Approach:** Store complete graph snapshots for each epoch

**Pros:**
- Can perfectly recreate graph state at any point
- Can re-run analyses on historical graphs

**Cons:**
- Massive storage requirements
- Complex to implement and maintain
- Not the core problem we're solving

**Decision:** Not pursuing. Users can implement their own graph versioning if needed.

---

### Alternative 2: Streaming/Event-Based Tracking
**Approach:** Use event stream (Kafka, Kinesis) for catalog updates

**Pros:**
- Decoupled from main application
- Can support real-time dashboards
- Scalable

**Cons:**
- Added infrastructure complexity
- Overkill for initial use case
- Harder to query historical data

**Decision:** Not for v1. Consider for v2 if real-time requirements emerge.

---

### Alternative 3: Embedded in Result Collections
**Approach:** Store execution metadata as part of result documents

**Pros:**
- No separate catalog storage
- Results are self-describing

**Cons:**
- Duplicates metadata across all result documents
- Harder to query across executions
- Mixes concerns (results vs metadata)

**Decision:** Not pursuing. Separate catalog provides better separation of concerns.
