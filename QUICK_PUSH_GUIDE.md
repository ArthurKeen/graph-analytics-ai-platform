# Quick Guide: Push to GitHub as Private Repo

## Steps

### 1. Create Private Repository on GitHub

1. Go to: **https://github.com/new**
2. Fill in:
   - **Repository name:** `graph-analytics-ai`
   - **Description:** "Unified library for orchestrating ArangoDB Graph Analytics Engine operations"
   - **Visibility:** Select **Private** 🔒
   - **DO NOT** check:
     - ❌ Add a README file
     - ❌ Add .gitignore
     - ❌ Choose a license
   (We already have these files)
3. Click **"Create repository"**

### 2. Copy the Repository URL

After creating, GitHub will show you a page with commands. You'll see a URL like:
- `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/graph-analytics-ai.git`
- or `git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/graph-analytics-ai.git`

**Copy that URL** - you'll need it in the next step.

### 3. Add Remote and Push

Once you have the URL, tell me your GitHub username and I'll set it up, OR run these commands:

```bash
cd /Users/arthurkeen/code/graph-analytics-ai

# Add remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your actual GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/graph-analytics-ai.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

### 4. Verify

```bash
# Check remote is set
git remote -v

# Should show:
# origin  https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/graph-analytics-ai.git (fetch)
# origin  https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/graph-analytics-ai.git (push)
```

## Alternative: I Can Help

If you tell me your GitHub username, I can:
1. Set up the remote for you
2. Prepare the push command
3. You just need to authenticate when pushing

**What's your GitHub username?**
